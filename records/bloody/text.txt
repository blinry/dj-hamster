~ A Bloody Small World ~

Made together with Moritz, Pecca, and Winnie for Ludum Dare 38. Sometimes we worked in my living room, sometimes remotely! I think we made a great team, complementing each other really well.

This is a racing game that takes place inside a human blood stream. You are teaching a class of red blood cells how to take oxygen from the lungs to the organs.

Winnie produced the soundtrack for this game. It consists of the songs "Blood Cell Intro", "Blood Cell Party", and "Blood Cell Blues".

You can find the game at morr.cc/bloody/
