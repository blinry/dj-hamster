~ Capitalist Piggies ~

Made during my stay at the Recurse Center (a self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers in New York City), together with Agustín, Alan, Byung, and Tim.

This is a game about fast reactions, planning, and cute piggies! You play as a piggy bank that wants to escape a real bank, guarded by cute, but rather dangerous banker piggies.

Music by (surprise, surprise) Kevin MacLeod, the second track is "Quirky Dog", and I can't for the life of me figure out what the first one is called.

The game is at morr.cc/capitalist-piggies/
