~ Arden's Artisan Artefacts ~

Made with Kiki, larkinia, Lena, and Pecca. In this game, you sell built-to-order sacrifice sculpture made exactly according to your customers' wishes! It's a game about resource management, and allows for a lot of visual creativity.

We did a lot of pair programming for this game, and used a Kanban board to great success! We felt very professional. Heh.

The music is "Industrial Ferret" by Kevin MacLeod.
