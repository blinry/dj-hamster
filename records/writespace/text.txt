Made in 2018 with Kiki and larkinia. Lena and rohieb jumped in at the end and helped making the game look pretty! <3

In this puzzle game, you are a typewriter that can change typing direction! Probably the most successful Ludum Dare entry I've been part of, getting 1st place in "Innovation", 3rd place in "Fun", and 2nd place overall!

The song is "Darkest Child" by Kevin MacLeod. You can download the game at morr.cc/writespace/

A lot of pistachios were harmed in the making of this game.
