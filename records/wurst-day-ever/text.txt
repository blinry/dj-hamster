~ Wurst Day Ever ~

A solo entry for the Global Game Jam 2020. It's a puzzle game where you push around pieces of sausage on an island. Repair them all to win! This is another game with simple rules, but interesting consequences, and got a lot of praise at the jam.

Winnie made some really catchy music for this game! The song is called "Sausage Salsa".

You can play the game in your browser at morr.cc/wurst-day-ever/

This is the last record in this collection. Thanks for playing "DJ Hamster", and thanks to everyone who has made games with me! <3
