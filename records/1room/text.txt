~ Was ist das f√ºr 1 Room? ~

Made together with Leslie and Moritz at the end of 2016. I was travelling in Japan at the time, but working together across time zones worked surprisingly well! I remember eating delicious snacks from a nearby conbini.

In this puzzle game, you are tasked to arrange furniture in some interestingly-shaped rooms, observing certain constraints. People consistently need about one hour to finish this game. It got 8th place in the "Fun" category!

The song is called "Welcome", made on a Gameboy by the Dutch music maker RoccoW.
