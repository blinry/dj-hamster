== Was ist das f√ºr 1 Room? ==

Made together with Leslie and Moritz in the end of 2016. I was travelling Japan at the time, but working together across time zones worked surprisingly well!

In this puzzle game, you are tasked to arrange furniture in some interestingly-shaped rooms, observing certain constraints (for example, you must not place bookshelves in front of windows). People consistently seem to need about an hour to complete the game! Find it at morr.cc/1room/.
