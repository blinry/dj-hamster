== Splendid Adventures on a Sunday Afternoon ==

This game is half platformer, half children's book. You jump around on words and sentences, and can make choices. Made in a large team with larkinia, Mai, rohieb, Winnie, and Bonus-Steffi. Ummm, we used SVG as a level format for this one. I don't want to talk about it.

The soundtrack was made by Winnie and consists of the tracks "A Walk in the Forest", "After the Rain", "Ruins", and "Dream Land". CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
